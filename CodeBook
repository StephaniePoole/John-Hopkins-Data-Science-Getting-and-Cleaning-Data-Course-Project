John Hopkins Data Science Course Project Code Book

Introduction
=========================================
This code book describes the following items for this project: 
1. Variable definitions 
2. The data
3. The transformations that were performed to clean up the data

The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps mentioned in the README.md file.

Dataset includes the following files:
=========================================
README.txt
features_info.txt: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
features.txt: List of all features.
activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.
train/X_train.txt: Training set.
train/y_train.txt: Training labels.
test/X_test.txt: Test set.
test/y_test.txt: Test labels.

The train and test data 
=========================================
train/subject_train.txt: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Additional Description
===========================================
The data is merged using the rbind() function. If there are multiples of the same number of columns and names, then those are addressed in order to simplify.
Based on requirement #2 in the README.md project description, only columns with the mean and standard deviation measurements are taken from the dataset. 
After getting the required columns, we have to give them the correct names, which we can get from the features.txt.
The activity data is labeled with numbers 1 through 6, so we took the activity names and associated number values 
from activity_labels.txt and are replaced in the dataset. In general the dataset didn't have column names that meant anything 
so those were corrected to make the dataset understable to a broader audience. Now that we have cleaned the data, filtered the data to only
have the mean & standard deviation and added understable names, the final output file was saved as tidy_data.txt via the write.table() function.
